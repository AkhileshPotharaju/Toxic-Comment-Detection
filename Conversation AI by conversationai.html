<h1 id="research-resources">Research resources</h1>

<p>This page outlines the high level questions we are exploring. Further related research can be found on the <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Detox/Resources">WikiDetox outline of related work</a>.</p>

<p>We also have a page that provides <a href="https://conversationai.github.io/ml_intro.html">a brief introduction to ML</a> to help make this research easier to understand.</p>

<h2 id="public-datasets">Public datasets</h2>

<p>One of our contributions is to produce datasets to support research:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification">Civil Comments annotated with toxicity and identity content Kaggle Competition</a>: A public <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> competition, based on data from the <a href="https://medium.com/@aja_15265/saying-goodbye-to-civil-comments-41859d3a2b1d">Civil Comments</a> platform, which shut down in 2017. This data is annotated for toxicity, toxicity sub-types, and mentions of identities, which enables evaluation of unintended bias with respect to identity mentions. See Kaggle page for detailed description of data source and annotation schema.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge">Wikipedia Talk Page Comments annotated with toxicity reasons Kaggle Competition</a>: A public <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> competition, based on a crowdsourced dataset that includes 4 toxicity sub-types (reasons why something might be considered toxic), and approx 160k human labelled comments from Wikipedia Talk pages. The labelled annotations are based on asking 5000 crowd-workers to rate Wikipedia comments according to their toxicity (likely to make others leave the conversation). This dataset is also available on <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/Wikipedia_Talk_Labels_Toxicity/4563973">Figshare as the Wikipedia Human Annotations of Toxicity on Talk Pages</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://figshare.com/articles/Wikipedia_Detox_Data/4054689">Wikipedia Human Annotations of Personal Attacks on Talk Pages</a>: 100k Comments from wikipedia each with 10 annotations by the 4000 annotators who contributed to the effort. Each comment annotation notes whether the annotator considers the comment to be a personal attack or not.</li>
  <li><a href="https://figshare.com/articles/Wikipedia_Talk_Corpus/4264973">Wikipedia Machine Annotations of Talk Pages</a>: machine-labelled annotations for every English Wikipedia talk page comment from 2001 to 2015, approximately 95 million comments to support large scale data analysis.</li>

<h2 id="open-source-code">Open Source Code</h2>

<p>We also have various public github projects to support research into having better converstions online:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/conversationai/conversationai-moderator">Moderator</a> - a moderation tool to support using machine learning models to assist a human review process (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/insider/have-a-comment-leave-a-comment.html">used by the New York Times</a>). There are also repositories that provide plugins for using moderator to support other platforms (<a href="https://github.com/conversationai/conversationai-moderator-reddit">moderator for reddit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/conversationai/conversationai-moderator-wordpress">moderator for wordpress</a>, <a href="https://github.com/conversationai/conversationai-moderator-discourse">moderator for discourse</a>)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/conversationai/perspectiveapi-authorship-demo">An Authorship Experience</a> - code to build authorship experiences that give feedback to people as they type. This is used in <a href="https://perspectiveapi.com/">our public demo of perspective API</a>, but the code repository includes many additional features and ways to create other auhtorship experiences.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/conversationai/unintended-ml-bias-analysis">Measuring and Mitigating Unintended Bias</a> - our repository for tools to measure and mitigated unintended bias our modles.

  <li><a href="https://github.com/conversationai/conversationai-crowdsource">Crowdsource</a> - Experimental tools to support crowdsourcing annotations.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/conversationai/wikidetox">wikidetox</a> - our ongoing work with Wikimedia to create a useful corpus of Talk Page conversations on wikipedia.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also have some smaller projects that provide specific technical demonstration code for working with <a href="https://perspectiveapi.com/">the Perspective API</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/conversationai/perspectiveapi-js-client">perspectiveapi-js-client</a> - A simple JavaScript client library for calling the Perspective API.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/conversationai/perspectiveapi-simple-server">perspectiveapi-simple-server</a> - A simple <a href="https://expressjs.com/">expresss</a> based proxy server that can hold your API-key and calls the Perspective API.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/conversationai/perspectiveapi-proxy">perspectiveapi-proxy</a> - A <a href="https://expressjs.com/">express</a> based simple proxy server that can be used to provide restricted access to your Perspective API cloud project.</li>

<h2 id="research-contributions">Research Contributions</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.396/">Toxicity Detection: Does Context Really Matter?</a> studies the importance of  context, and when as well as to what extent it can change the perceived toxicity of posts, finding that context can both amplify or mitigate the perceived toxicity of posts, and moreover for a subset of the data that including context can even reverse the toxicity label.</li>
  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05476">Classifying Constructive Comments (preprint)</a> introduces a new dataset of constructive comments, defines a taxonomy of characteristics of constructiveness, and provides models for constructiveness trained on this dataset.</li>

  <li><a href="https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub48120">Model Cards for Model Reporting</a> proposes a framework to encourage transparent reporting of the context, use-cases, and performance characteristics of machine learning models across domains.</li>
  <li><a href="https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub48094">Nuanced Metrics for Measuring Unintended Bias with Real Data for Text Classification</a> introduces a suite of threshold-agnostic metrics that provide a nuanced view of unintended bias in text classification, by exploring the various ways that a classifier’s score distribution can vary across designated groups.</li>
